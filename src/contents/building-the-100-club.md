description: A quick update on our next stage.
---

So a while ago, I wrote a post about how I was considering building an entrepreneurial community.

Well, I went ahead to do it, with my partner, Joseph (whom I wouldn't have been able to do it without).

Feel free to check out our WIP website!
We're calling it [The 100 Club](https://the100club.io/) - and we've already got over 20+ interested student founders.

#### The Problem

Entrepreneurship is difficult - itâ€™s lonely, itâ€™s tough to hold yourself accountable, and itâ€™s not easy to explore uncharted territories. Where do you go to connect with others and solve these issues as an entrepreneur? Resume-padding societies arenâ€™t a good fit, and neither are accelerators that only cater to investment-ready startups. A new community is needed.

#### The Solution

The 100 Club is an exclusive mastermind community, that matches real entrepreneurial individuals into groups of 4, in order for them to support each other in staying accountable, sharing advice, and networking to grow their business.

#### Vision

To help entrepreneurial individuals, be entrepreneurs

## It wasn't always so clear.

So we seem to be stating the direction for The 100 Club with a lot of clarity now, but the truth is, it wasn't always so clear.

Thinking back, it was literally just us going around pitching some vague, scattered concept that I wrote about in my previous article, to various individuals within our networks. I always prefer to move quickly on ideas, so there was no real concrete plan - yet. It was just a lot of experimentation and discussion with other entrepreneurs to see what they wanted, and if they were interested in joining. At one point in time, we were meeting founders for lunch and dinner every day, for two weeks, during our schooling semester.

But it was this process which provided some much-needed groundwork to help solidify what we could do to contribute to their success. The pitch and concept evolved, pivoted and became more refined with each subsequent individual we talked to, to become what it is today.

## So what's next?

Well, we've got huge, huge plans for the future. We're already working on building our custom membership platform, which also fulfils the requirement for a school module - two birds with one stone ðŸ’Ž.

It will contain access to:

- Exclusive Swag Merchandise
- Membership Directory
- Mentorship Access
- Quarterly Networking Events
- And much more.

We're also planning on building partnerships with incubators & accelerators, as well as with other companies like restaurants so that members can have meals and network there at a discounted price.

But for now, we're mainly focusing on getting our beta cohort, Cohort 000, set up, and then we're going to build up towards getting signups for Cohort 001, which will launch either in July or August.

Once again, a huge shout out to my partner, Joseph, and the rest of the team, for making this project a possibility. Appreciate all the hard work behind the scenes.

This was just a short little update, but do stay tuned for future updates in the coming months and if you're an entrepreneur - consider joining the waitlist for Cohort 001 on our website. Cheers.
