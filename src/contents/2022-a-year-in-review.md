Forgive me in advance if my thoughts here aren't as organised and bulleted as they usually are. While I do prefer the "breaking things down into points" approach, I thought I'd attempt to start a little bit more messily and just write as I go. Although to be fair, this is really just an excuse for being too lazy to be coherent.

Anyways, it's been a very long, short year. It feels incredibly short looking back, but the content of the year itself as I was caught up in it just felt incredibly long.

It's been a while since I've wrote, but I thought this could help get me out of the dazey pit I'm stuck in currently.
