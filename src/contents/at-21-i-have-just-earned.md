My one tip:

**Try and secure long-term working relationships.**

Benefits:

1. Consistent income + higher likelihood of good JSS feedback can help boost your Upwork statistics a lot faster. Youâ€™ll essentially be able to build out your account statistics with these few anchor clients, which will in turn help you secure future one-off contracts.
2. Not having to waste time trying to secure new contracts. Instead of spending time playing a numbers game and spamming proposals + praying, you can focus on your few key clients and actually do your job.
3. Get familiar with your client's working style. Trying to satisfy one client is a lot easier than managing a handful simultaneously.

I recognise that this relatively simple tip comes with big caveats. Some may argue that it defeats the purpose of freelancing, given that you're tied down as you normally would be working a 9-5. Others may say that this doesn't apply to their field. All valid points.

But similar to building any sort of online presence, I believe there's a lot of grinding that needs to be done in the beginning. You'll probably need to take up contracts you aren't interested in, or work with people you aren't a fan of - and getting tied down with a long-term contract really isn't so different. It's all in the name of building that foundation. Once it's built, you're honestly good to go. Apply for the jobs you want. Pick and choose from clients as you wish.

Happy to answer any questions or help where I can.
