Here it is - [Olympus Origins](https://olympusorigins.com/)

Just wanted to share a simple landing page I built over the past week. Know it’s not exactly something to show off, but I’m quite please with how it turned out.

Currently trying to improve HTML & CSS skills through additional personal projects + front end mentor.

Honestly crazy excited for what’s to come. I know HTML & CSS is basic and not even considered a coding language, but I feel like a world of possibility has opened up with just these skills.
