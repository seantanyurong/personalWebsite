[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seantanyurong/) probably gives a better overview, but here's a short little summary.

## what I've done professionally

1. 👮🏽 Attended Officer Cadet School (OCS) in the Singapore Armed Forces, commissioning in the top 15%, and achieved the rank of Lieutenant during my National Service tenure.
2. 🚀 Worked full-time as a Marketing Coordinator (and eventually promoted to Marketing Operations Lead) at an Australian B2B SaaS startup in the childcare space. Supporting automation and martech initiatives.
3. 🛏️ Worked as the Operations Lead at a hotel pod startup aiming to revitalise small towns in Australia.
4. ✅ Top Rated Plus Landing Page Developer on Upwork. Top 3% on the world's largest freelancing platform. 100% job success score. $45k+ earnings.
5. 🥼 Worked at Deloitte as a Tech Consulting Intern. Figured I wanted to get a little exposure to the corporate life, since I'd spent so much time with startups.
6. 👾 Worked at Oceanus as a Software Engineering Intern. My first experience properly working in a software engineering team.

## what I've done not so professionally

1. 🛩️ Attained a flying license before I could legally drive at the Singapore Youth Flying Club (1 of 31 graduates in 2018)
